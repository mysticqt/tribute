        <h1>My Opa The Awesomest Guy Ever!</h1>


        <h3>The Man The Myth</h3>
    <p> My Opa was and still is my Hero, he was one person I looked up to. He gave the greatest of advice and always had an ear and big arms to listen to me cry and hug it out. Any time I was going through anything he was there for me always having my back. He taught me that having a high paying job that made you miserable isn’t always the best place to be. Its no always about the income Sabrina, he’d say. You gotta find yourself a job that is going to make you happy and be great on your wellbeing. If you slave away at a job that pays well but treats you like shit, you will eventually burn out or start having health problems. I take that to heart, to many times have worked at places where my coworkers died or had mental breakdowns at work because the job stressed them out. Anyways Opa was there for everyone, I honestly never met a person that didn’t like my Opa. If you needed help, he was there, if you needed a good laugh he was there. He did the best Donald Duck impersonation.  It was better than Donald Duck himself! He loved all of us grandchildren and told us the best stories ever. </p>

    <h3>Love and Jokes</h3>
    <p> My Opa was also my inspiration for wanting to have a long-lasting relationship with someone. Him and my oma where together until the day he passed. The two of them did everything together. On days my oma decided to travel to other states to visit family he would literally sulk at home until she came home to him. It was the cutest thing. He would light up like a Christmas tree when she walked through the door and the kisses were none stop. Then the shit talking would commence but it was all playful banter.  She is an angry German and him a fun-loving Englishmen LOL. </p>

        <h3>Military Man and Story Teller</h3>
    <p> Opa was also in the military he was a mechanic, there wasn’t anything he couldn’t fix. He even built a motorcycle from the ground up. I used to hover over him all the time watching him build this kick ass motorcycle. He was always so proud too; he’d say to me Sabrina I just picked up this part at a great price and its perfect for this bike. My opa also taught me how to hold my breath for a long time under water. He told he his buddies taught him the proper breathing technique on hold your breath underwater. Man, he always had great stories to tell me to about his military buddies and all the great places he traveled to while in the military. All those awesome adventures, man I am jealous! </p>

        <H3>The Opti mistic</H3>
    <p> Now my opa isn’t here with us anymore he was taken to soon, he was at the end stage of COPD. I was thankful to hear that he passed away peacefully in his sleep. Which brings me to another thought I had, the last time I saw my opa he told me I’ll see you soon. Neither of us knew it at the time, but that was our last goodbye. This image I am gonna show is of him in the hospital bed, but it means a lot to me because it was the last time, I saw him alive, and even though he was all strapped up in machinery he still managed to put a smile on his face and tell a joke or two and be optimistic. The picture is right before we arrived, they thought he was going at that time but he pulled through and said nope I am gonna have a little more time so I can spend it with my family. And he did, it was a lovely day. I just loved the fact that he fought and held on for a little while long and still managed to laugh and smile and tell us jokes and stay optimistic. </p>

        <h3>A Song That Says It All</h3>
    <p> My Opa kills me he request that we played 2 specific songs one of which had people in an uproar for a moment and the rest of us laughing our asses off. He was a funny guy who lived for laughing and being a good human being. He had a warped sense of humor and I think I should share the song we played for him.  I think he would appreciate the laugh. </p>

    <h3>In The End </h3>
    <p> I want to end this with I still feel my grandfather around me. Sometimes when I am down and don’t know what to do I feel like I have him whispering in my ear telling me its okay. Sometimes I even think I hear him telling me what to do, like he did when he was still alive. I miss him dearly and I know the rest of the family misses the hell out of him too. I’ll see you again some day Opa, until that day comes, I will continue to live my life happy and optimistic. I’ll make people smile like you did and give the great advice to others just like you. I look up to you and always will. </p>
